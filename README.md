--- The Peer-To-Peer Data Transfer doesn't work in IE/Safari. <br>
--- It works in "both desktop/laptop as well as in mobile" only functional with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. I haven't tested with Opera yet. It's super fast in Android. <br>
<br>
Advantages:- <br>
--- Fast Transfer. <br>
--- 100% Privacy.
